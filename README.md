# Mastering Forecasting with VAR Models

This repository is home to a Jupyter notebook that delves into the intricacies of Vector Autoregression (VAR) Modeling, with a focus on forecasting electricity prices using related time series data like gas prices and weather conditions. The notebook is meticulously structured to guide users through every step of the VAR modeling process, from data preparation to forecasting.

## Contents

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Detailed code with explanatory comments, capturing each phase of the VAR modeling process.
- **Data Files**: The dataset used for analysis, including time series data on electricity prices, gas prices, and weather conditions.

## Companion Medium Post

For a thorough exploration of the concepts, methodologies, and insights behind the analyses and codes in this notebook, please refer to my comprehensive Medium post: [Mastering Forecasting: Unveiling the Power of VAR Modeling for Dynamic Time Series Prediction](https://medium.com/@[YourMediumUsername]/mastering-forecasting-unveiling-the-power-of-var-modeling-for-dynamic-time-series-prediction-[UniquePostID]). The post provides an in-depth narrative that complements the technical content of this notebook, ideal for both newcomers and seasoned practitioners in the field of time series forecasting.

## Getting Started

To get started with the notebook:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed, or use [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) for an online environment.
3. Install necessary Python packages: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `statsmodels`.

## Contribution

Your contributions to improving the notebook or expanding the analysis are most welcome. Feel free to fork the repository and submit pull requests.
